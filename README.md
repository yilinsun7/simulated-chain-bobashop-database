# Simulated Chain Bobashop Database

### NOTE: this is an on-going project and will be updated regularly. 

**Time:** August 2024 - present 

**Coursework:** DATA201 Database Technology for Data Analysts 

**Programming Language:** MySQL, Python 

**Keywords:** Database design, relational schema design, inserting and deleting data, MySQL querying with various conditions, etc. 

Imagine that we are dealing with data of a chain boba tea shop. We have thoudsands of records of employee information, 
store information, product information, and customer information, and all of them are related. We know which employee works at which store, which customer purchased 
which products, which products are sold at which stores. How to most efficiently keep records of various types of inter-connected data information? Three of my teammates and I designed a relational schema in an attempt to answer that question. 

This ongoing project showcases our workflow of designing a relational schema from scratch using MySQL, in addition to inserting and deleting data, and making queries. In this repository, you can find the following supporting files: 
1. `boba_erdiagram.png`: An Entity-Relationship diagram that outlines the basic components of our database, created with ERDplus;
2. `boba_rs.png`: A visual representation of the relational schema, their relationship, and their columns;
3. `create_insert_display.ipynb`: This notebook connects to the database with Python and implemented the create tables, insert data values, and display tables as dataframe commands;
4. `groupby_case_nested_views_joins.ipynb`: This notebook connects to the database with Python and implemented grouping, creating views, left and right joins, and certain nested queries;
5. `boba_shop.ini`: 
6.  and `database_utilities.py`
